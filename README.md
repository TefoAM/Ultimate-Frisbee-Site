I built this website using HTML5 and CSS3

This website is developed using HTML5 and CSS3. It's just practice. no sweat! lol.

Clone the repo to your machine and just use your browser to open the index.html file, which serves as the home page. Click the navigation buttons in the header to visit other pages of the site.
